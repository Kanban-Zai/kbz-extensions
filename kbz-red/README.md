# Kanban-Zai Extension "Red"

Kanban-Zai RED is a time to market optimised process.  

CAVEAT: Time to market does not mean a really fast time to market, it means as quick as you can given your knowledge
and understanding of your market, product and business model and constraints known or unknown.

### FAILFAST

In a rapid release environment you are not always going to have the best value proposition, so a good strategy is to
try and find out really quickly that you are wrong. This will enable you to pivot quickly.

#### RELEASE EARLY RELEASE OFTEN

This strategy allows you to dig deeper into your market which naturally allows you to design better value propositions.
