# Kanban-Zai Extension "Blue"

Kanban-Zai BLUE is a B.A.U delivery process.

BLUE is the companion to RED.  The difference being that BLUE operates within the contextual boundaries of the product
that RED created.

BLUE is not a process that allows the same type of flexibily as RED, but it does offer the same low process overhead.

If large cards start appearing regularly that is a signal that a RED team may need to be spun up for a subsequent
phase of product development.

# Technical Owner

An interesting feature of BLUE is the inclusion of a Technical Owner, whose purpose is keep the quality output of the 
delivery team high by helping the business owner and product owner write relevant value proposals.

A technical owner can give 2 different types of advice.  Opinion and considered opinon.  Considered opinion is a best 
guess based heavily on past experience and is formal advice given to the team.  Opinion is not formal advice.  

A technical owner does not give expert advice or any advice on Artifical Intellegence except where they have explicitly
stated that they are an "expert in a niche" or have explicitly stated they enough experience in the articifial 
intelligence domain to give a considered opinion.
