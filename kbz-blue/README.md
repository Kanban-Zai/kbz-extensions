# Kanban-Zai Extension "Blue"

Kanban-Zai BLUE is a Business As Usual delivery process.

The purpose of the blue process is to solve the problem that the red process presents to it, that being transitioning the project into B.A.U mode.

To run a B.A.U. team you. require a process that can provide absolute trust to all parties.  How is this trust created?  

1. I am allow to pick the card up, and there will never be a negative outcome because I picked up the card.
2. If commence work on the card, it should have the contextual boundries described on it so I am free to explore the solution.
4. If I finish work on the card then no one will question me on the result as long as it satisfies a Rational Outcome Model.
5. I must be free to reject the card if it doesnt satisfy a satisfies a Rational Outcome Model.


There are 2 test scenarios that help explain how this form of trust works by keeping the trust equation at the forefront of our minds.

In the first situation, as a developer in a vacuum, there is no way of gauging the self orientation of the author so I must rely soley on the left hand side of the equation Vibability + Credibility + Reliability.  In other words who wrote the card and how well it is written.

In this scenario the process must control and reduce the self orientation side of the equation.


This means the delivery cycle must be behind the development cycle to a varying degree to allow a time cushion, because things go wrong.

Test Case 2: In group situation team norms help guide the behavior of the team

test case 3: an advanced delivery projection


# Technical Owner

An interesting feature of BLUE is the inclusion of a Technical Owner, whose purpose is keep the quality output of the 
delivery team high by helping the business owner and product owner write relevant value proposals.

A technical owner can give 2 different types of advice.  Opinion and considered opinon.  Considered opinion is a best 
guess based heavily on past experience and is formal advice given to the team.  Opinion is not formal advice.  

A technical owner does not give expert advice or any advice on Artifical Intellegence except where they have explicitly
stated that they are an "expert in a niche" or have explicitly stated they enough experience in the articifial 
intelligence domain to give a considered opinion.
