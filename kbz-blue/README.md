# Kanban-Zai Extension "Blue"

Kanban-Zai BLUE is a B.A.U delivery process.

BLUE is the companion to RED.  The difference being that BLUE operates within the contextual boundaries of the product
that RED created.

BLUE is not a process that allows the same type of flexibily as RED, but it does offer the same low process overhead.

If large cards start appearing regularly that is a signal that a RED team may need to be spun up for a subsequent
phase of product development.

An interesting feature of BLUE is the inclusion of a Technical Owner, whose purpose is keep the quality output of the 
delivery team high by helping the business owner and product owner write relevant value proposals.
